# Supersequence instances
Bart Massey

This is a collection of instance files for the
Supersequences Micro-Project.

There are three collections of five randomly-generated
instances using different parameters.

* The instances labeled `superseq-3-20-4` have short
  solutions and are relatively easy to solve optimally.

* The `superseq-3-40-4` instances are probably too large
  to brute-force, so are harder.

* The `superseq-4-40-5` instances are of similar difficulty,
  but are of a slightly different character.
